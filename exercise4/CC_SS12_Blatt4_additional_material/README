How to run:

  * Download & unzip Stratosphere binary distribution (v0.1.2)
	  * Start Stratosphere in local deployment: bin/start-local.sh
	  * Start Stratosphere visualization (optional): bin/nephele-visualization.sh

  * Download TPC-H tools, compile using make and create datasets with dbgen tool
	  

  * In cc-uebung4
    * The cc-uebung4 folder can be imported as an "Existing Maven Project" into an Eclipse with Maven Support. This will
      get you started quickly as maven will resolve all dependencies such as the pact-common library

	* customersFile
	* ordersFile
	* outputFile

    * Build job using maven by executing 'mvn package'

    * Submit job to PACTs/Nephele using pact-client.sh in Stratosphere binary distribution:
     ./pact-client.sh run -v -j /path/to/cc-uebung4/target/cc-uebung4-0.0.1.jar

    * Watch job progress in Stratosphere visualization :)
